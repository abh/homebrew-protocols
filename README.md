Homebrew: Protocols
===================

These formulae are for Homebrew, a package management system for MacOS.

What is here
------------

Anything which catches my fancy but is too obscure for Homebrew, which I
suspect will involve dealing with miscellaneous protocols in various ways.

* `sieve-connect.rb`: this is for my own sieve-connect tool, which is
   packaged for various OS distributions.  It speaks ManageSieve.


How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------

Just `brew tap philpennock/protocols` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can
`brew install philpennock/protocols/<formula>`.
